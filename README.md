# 120 years of horror movies
##Summary
In this visualisation I want to explore keywords for horror movies filmed from 1896 to 2016 to understand how things that frightened people changed with time. As a source of data I chose The Movie Database (TMDb).
##Design
I decided to do my visualisation as an animated bubble chart with possibility to chose a decade you want to look at and added tooltips to show information about every keyword.
